% other detection options:
% to specity the reference lag 
% ref_lag=2; % more strict correction on the non stationarity, you find less assemblies
% ref_lag=4;% less strict correction on the non stationarity, you find more assemblies
% [As_across_bins,As_across_bins_index,assembly]=CADopti(spM,MaxLags,BinSizes, ref_lag);

% to detect only unit pairs
% [As_across_bins,As_across_bins_index,assembly]=CADopti(spM,MaxLags,BinSizes, [],[],[],2);   

% to change the significance level (this algorithm, with respect to CAD, it has a harsher multiple 
% comparison correction on the significance level, you might therefore also relax a bit the 0.05 alpha level)
% [As_across_bins,As_across_bins_index,assembly]=CADopti(spM,MaxLags,BinSizes,[],0.1);
